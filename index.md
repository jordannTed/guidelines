Our mission is to democratize access to the career advice underserved youth need to create professional goals 
and understand their personal paths to those goals. CareerVillage.org enables young people to get that advice
by giving them access to professionals from whom to seek guidance. Together they make up our community. 

We want people to get the most out of CareerVillage, so we created guidelines to help community members 
understand how best to contribute. To ensure what’s posted on CareerVillage meets these guidelines, every piece 
of content is looked at and moderated for appropriateness. We also offer coaching to our community members to 
make their advice the best available anywhere. 

**What you can expect to see in our guidelines:**
- [CareerVillage.org community members](http://guide.careervillage.org/#careervillageorg-community-members)-who they are and why they exist 
- [Community team](http://guide.careervillage.org/#careervillageorg-community-team)-who they are and what they do
- [What is not allowed](http://guide.careervillage.org/#what-is-not-allowed)
- [Do’s and Don’ts](http://guide.careervillage.org/#dos-and-donts)
- [How we respond when content does not meet our guidelines](http://guide.careervillage.org/#what-we-do-when-content-doesnt-meet-our-guidelines)
- [Changes to our guidelines](http://guide.careervillage.org/#changes-to-our-guidelines)-what happens when our guidelines get updated

**Students**  
Students are advice seekers, typically between the age of 13-24, and have not yet entered the workforce. 

**Professionals**  
Professionals give Students advice. They are most typically out of school and in the workforce. Sometimes professionals

Educators are our career readiness champions, who incorporate CareerVillage into their curriculums to get Students on to

**Moderators (a.k.a “Mods”)**  
Mods are CareerVillage users-turned-volunteers who commit to (collectively) looking at every piece of content that’s

**Administrators (a.k.a “Admins”)**

**Coaches**  
Coaches are people who contact other members of the community to proactively provide coaching or suggestions to make sure 
advice on CareerVillage is the best you can find on the internet. They know all the content Do’s and Don’ts, outlined below,
and coach community members on how to post great content. 
 
**You**

## What is not allowed
We do not tolerate any form of disrespectful or degrading behavior on CareerVillage, and moderate for content that distracts
the community from what they’re there to do. Subjects and behavior we never allow on CareerVillage are outlined below:

- **Bullying**
- **Hate speech**  
    Includes content that directly attacks people based on their: 
    - Race
    - Ethnicity
    - National origin
    - Religious affiliation
    - Sexual orientation
    - Sex, gender, or gender identity
    - Serious disabilities or diseases
- **Illegal activity**

- **Trolling**
- **Profanity**
- **Personal contact information**  
    To respect the safety and privacy of our community members, we do not allow community members to post their phone number, email
	address, or home address. Students are also only able to publicize their first name and the first initial of their last name. 
- **Spam**
- **Recruiting or evangelizing for one cause over another**
- **Profile photo(s) that are off topic**  
    We define “off topic” in this context as any image that does not have you in it and/or is not relevant to your profession.
- **Attempts to organize communications outside of our community**  
    For safety reasons, this includes inviting people to contact you, follow you, or connect with you outside of CareerVillage.org.
 
## Do’s and Don’ts
**For Students**  
**Do’s**
- Use proper grammar and spelling.
- Give your question context that clearly states why an answer to that question will help you be better prepared for your future. 
  Any question can be a career question with the right context! We have found that questions with longer context messages tend to 
  get answered with longer pieces of advice, from more people, and more quickly than questions with very short context messages. 
- Ask one question at a time. Questions are free -- you can have as many as you want!
- Post original questions. ProTip: Search first, ask second. The fastest way to get an answer is to read it on another question 
  that is the same as yours!
- Ask direct follow up questions you have about the advice that was given as a comment on that piece of advice.
- Show your appreciation and express your thanks to Professionals for answering a question you found helpful as a comment to that 
  advice. 

**Don’ts**
- Post off topic content. We define “off topic” as any content that isn’t relevant to your education, career, professional development,
  or planning for your future professional success. 
- Ask for a job, internship, donation, or other form of gift or opportunity. 
- Post a brand new question (not a follow up to a specific piece of advice) you have as a comment. A brand new question should be 
  posted as a new question, not as a comment!
- Ask about your homework if you’re only asking do get the assignment done or if your questions about your homework don’t actually 
  pertain to your career or future.

- Refer questions you cannot answer to people in your network you know can.
- Give another Professional kudos for an answer you think is great as a comment to that piece of advice.
- Include your job title, the company you work for, and/or industry you work in in your Headline.
- Include information about your education, job (past and present), work history, hobbies or any other information you think would be 
  helpful for Students to know about you in your “About me” section of your profile. 

**Don'ts**
- Post off topic content. We define “off topic” as any content that doesn’t directly answer or isn’t apparently relevant to the request
  for advice or topic being discussed. 
- Be discouraging of Students’ aspirations or plan.
- Provide misleading information about yourself or purposely about the subject matter you’re discussing. 
- Post ONLY a link and say “go find the answer over [there]”.
- Self-promote. 
- Post content in a language other than English (for the time being until CareerVillage.org has the capacity of moderators to support languages aside from English; _we encourage names to be in English for Students to read_).
- Directly offer employment or money to Students. You can, however, direct Students to an employment page (if you work for the company 
  you’re referring the Student to you need to explicitly say that). 
- Answer a question if you don’t have an answer or anything of value to contribute. You don’t have to answer every question that gets sent to you!
- Use our referral feature to harass people.
- Refer a question to someone you don’t know.
- Refer a question to someone who is not able to answer that question.
- Post a comment on another piece of advice that you want to add to. Post what you have to say as a separate answer instead!
- Include your personal mantra or philosophy (e.g., “Try harder every day!”) in your Headline.
- Leave your Headline or “About me” section in your profile blank!
- Upload a profile photo where we can’t see your face clearly (e.g. photos taken from too far away, blurry image, or a photo of a big group of people where we can’t see your face).
- Plagiarize. *Remember to cite the sources you reference in your advice!*

## What we do when content doesn’t meet our guidelines

Much of the content that violates the guidelines outlined above gets blocked by default before it even gets posted. On the rare occasion 
inappropriate content doesn’t automatically get caught, we take immediate action to rectify the situation. When our Community team believes content can be improved, or it doesn’t meet the guidelines outlined here, they’ll take action to coaching them to make it better. 

Depending on the content and its intent, we will do one or more of the following things:
- Remove it from the platform. 
- Contact community member(s) involved by email to request they take action or notify them of an action that was taken (e.g. “we’d like you
  to make a change to your content..”).
- Edit or make a change to the content. If we directly edit or change the content in any way we will always note clearly that an admin made a 
  change and explain why.
- Comment on it (the rest of the community can see this!) to inform the community members involved of an action that was taken or to request 
  they take an action. 
- Suspend community member(s). 

**Exceptions:** If there is a reason to make an exception to the guideline, or if something is flagged as inappropriate but does not meet any guideline outlined here, then Admins will discuss and come to a decision on how to address the issue.
